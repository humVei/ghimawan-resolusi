The "genex" program finds all permutations of strings that matches every
regular expressions specified in the command line, with full support
for back references (\1 .. \9) and word boundaries (\b).

The output is unsorted, but the order is deterministic across multiple runs:

    $ genex '\d' '[123abc]' # Must match both
    1.00000000              "2"
    1.00000000              "3"
    1.00000000              "1"

To enforce a fixed ordering for alternations, pipe the output to "sort -n":

    $ genex '(__|<>){1,3}' | sort -n
    2.00000000              "<>"
    2.00000001              "__"
    4.00000002              "<><>"
    4.00000003
